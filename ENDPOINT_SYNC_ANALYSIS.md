# Endpoint Synchronization Analysis & Fixes

## Current Issues Identified

### 1. Missing Backend Endpoints
The frontend is calling several endpoints that don't exist in the backend:

#### Preferences API Endpoints (Missing)
- `GET /api/preferences` - Called by frontend but not implemented
- `GET /api/preferences/{category}` - Called by frontend but not implemented  
- `PUT /api/preferences` - Called by frontend but not implemented
- `PUT /api/preferences/{category}` - Called by frontend but not implemented
- `POST /api/preferences/reset` - Called by frontend but not implemented
- `GET /api/preferences/export` - Called by frontend but not implemented
- `POST /api/preferences/import` - Called by frontend but not implemented
- `GET /api/preferences/templates` - Called by frontend but not implemented
- `POST /api/preferences/templates` - Called by frontend but not implemented
- `POST /api/preferences/templates/{id}/apply` - Called by frontend but not implemented
- `GET /api/preferences/schema` - Called by frontend but not implemented

#### Other Missing Endpoints
- `POST /api/auth/refresh` - Referenced in apiErrorHandler but not implemented
- `GET /api/chat/messages` - Referenced in syncService but not implemented
- `GET /api/documents` - Referenced in syncService but not implemented

### 2. API Loop Issues

#### Dashboard Component Loop
- **Issue**: `useEffect` depends on `[user, token]` which can change frequently
- **Problem**: Causes unnecessary API calls when auth state updates
- **Fix**: Add proper dependency management and loading states

#### Chat Component Multiple Effects
- **Issue**: Multiple `useEffect` hooks without proper cleanup
- **Problem**: Can cause race conditions and duplicate API calls
- **Fix**: Consolidate effects and add cleanup

#### Preferences Context Loop
- **Issue**: Multiple `useEffect` hooks that can trigger each other
- **Problem**: `preferences` state changes trigger localStorage saves which can cause re-renders
- **Fix**: Use `useCallback` and proper dependency arrays

### 3. Inconsistent Route Prefixes
- Some routes use `/api/` prefix, others don't
- Frontend expects consistent `/api/` prefix for all routes

## Fixes Required

### 1. Complete Preferences Backend Implementation
### 2. Fix API Loop Issues in Frontend
### 3. Add Missing Authentication Endpoints
### 4. Standardize Route Prefixes
### 5. Add Proper Error Handling for Missing Endpoints
