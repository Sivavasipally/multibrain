# Application Context Issue Fix

## Problem Encountered

After resolving the circular import issues, a new error appeared:

```
RuntimeError: Working outside of application context.

This typically means that you attempted to use functionality that needed
the current application. To solve this, set up an application context
with app.app_context(). See the documentation for more information.
```

**Location**: `user_preferences.py`, line 167:
```python
value = db.Column(JSON if db.engine.name == 'sqlite' else JSONB, nullable=False)
```

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by trying to access `db.engine.name` during import time, before the Flask application context was established. This happens when:

1. Python imports the `user_preferences.py` file
2. The class definition tries to determine the database engine type
3. `db.engine.name` requires an active Flask application context
4. No application context exists during import time

## Solution Applied

### 1. Replaced Dynamic Database Type Detection

**Before (Problematic)**:
```python
value = db.Column(JSON if db.engine.name == 'sqlite' else JSONB, nullable=False)
preferences = db.Column(JSON if db.engine.name == 'sqlite' else JSONB, nullable=False)
```

**After (Fixed)**:
```python
value = db.Column(db.JSON, nullable=False)
preferences = db.Column(db.JSON, nullable=False)
```

### 2. Removed Unnecessary Imports

Removed database-specific imports that were no longer needed:
```python
# Removed these imports
from sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql import JSONB
from sqlalchemy.dialects.sqlite import JSON
```

### 3. Benefits of Using db.JSON

SQLAlchemy's `db.JSON` type automatically:
- Uses appropriate storage for each database backend
- Handles SQLite's TEXT-based JSON storage
- Handles PostgreSQL's native JSON/JSONB types
- Eliminates need for runtime database type detection

## Files Modified

1. **`user_preferences.py`**:
   - Line 167: Changed dynamic JSON/JSONB selection to `db.JSON`
   - Line 531: Changed dynamic JSON/JSONB selection to `db.JSON`
   - Removed JSONB and JSON dialect imports

## Verification

All files pass syntax validation:
- ✅ `database.py` - Syntax valid
- ✅ `models.py` - Syntax valid  
- ✅ `context_versioning.py` - Syntax valid
- ✅ `user_preferences.py` - Syntax valid
- ✅ `routes/preferences.py` - Syntax valid
- ✅ `routes/versions.py` - Syntax valid

## Key Lessons

1. **Avoid Runtime Context Access at Import Time**: Never access Flask application context (like `db.engine`) during module import
2. **Use SQLAlchemy Abstractions**: `db.JSON` is more portable than database-specific types
3. **Import Order Matters**: Even after fixing circular imports, runtime context issues can occur
4. **Test Import Behavior**: Always test that modules can be imported without application context

## Result

The application should now start successfully without any:
- ❌ Circular import errors
- ❌ Application context errors  
- ❌ Runtime dependency issues
